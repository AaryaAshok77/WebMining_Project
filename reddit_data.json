For any task I have, I begin by writing a detailed prompt. Even if I receive a blueprint of what I need, I start by filling in a few lines, although I know they might be syntactically incorrect. I focus on coding the logic and then pass it to GPT to fix and return it, which has helped me tremendously in data analysis, visualizations, and scripting tasks. Perhaps I've learned a lot by using AI-generated code and have completed much of my work this way, but if you were to ask me to start writing a script from scratch, I don't think I'd be able to.\n\nI have massive imposter syndrome, and I feel like I want to go back to the basics and start coding DSA problems to refine my logic. As I progress to more challenging problems, I aim to improve my use of syntax effectively and gradually reduce the reliance on LLMs for coding. Can I even call myself a programmer anymore?\n\nI also realize that to succeed in this career, especially given how Computer Science is evolving, you have to be either highly proficient or skilled, If i cant even write code without chatgpt I feel disappointed to even call myself an engineer. Anyone else in the same spot? All and any advice is appreciated\n\nEdit:  \nGiven the diversity of comments in this entire post, I\u2019ve received eye-opening responses, I\u2019ve been reprimanded and even called a cheater for using AI, beyond that, I've also had an extensive argument with one person. Hearing both cases about riding the AI wave, which could render coding from scratch obsolete some time in the future, at the same time, there's the need to realize the fundamentals because, at a later stage in my career, I would be lost when fixing and understanding codebases of legacy systems or any real-world applications for that matter. All of this blows my mind.\n\nThrough all of these comments, my takeaway, for myself and anybody who would sort of consider my advice or rather opinion of a novice are that, although in the near future, everybody, even those not from a CS background, would be able to do generate boilerplate code and use it to accomplish their tasks or problems, the differentiator would be those who have clear fundamentals, LLMs yet aren't niche enough to spew passable code used in the real world. Also, with a personal bias, I feel that although at present a lot of people use LLMs for coding to some extent, personally, I'd still feel much more accomplished if I wrote up something by myself at the end of the day, even if my job gets done by using the LLMs with much less effort, this is my personal opinion and not the only right or correct way.\n\nSo, as much as I am dependent right now on using AI to write my code, moving forward, I'll shall try to mitigate this dependency. Hopefully, I'll be able to call myself a half-decent programmer then. I appreciate all your advice, Thank you!"}

It is perfectly normal. These videos/books teach you the basics of coding (and a lot of useless stuff) but there is much more to becoming a dev.\n\nI am a freelance dev so I am used to switch projects regularly, sometimes I have projects that last several years, sometimes I barely spend one month on a project. I also have a very strong grasp on IT in general (network packets analysis, Linux...) due to a background in support.\n\nWriting code is, at best, 20% of my job. And not a single time have I had to tackle an issue that looks like the exercises you get from courses/books. So what do I spend my time on?\n\n1) Meetings. As a junior dev, it might be 5% of your job. As a senior dev, it might be 80% of your job.\n\n2) Documentation. Either documenting the code or preparing \"stories\" for colleagues. While writing documentation might be a common task for junior devs, senior devs will often spend a lot of time writing \"stories\" so other devs know what the acceptance criteria is for the code they have to write.\n\n3) Learning the current code base. If you work on the same project for months or years, learning the code base does not represent a large percentage of your work. When I join a project for a month, it is not that uncommon for me to spend 50% of my time getting familiar with the code base.\n\n4) Reviewing/merging code. \n\n5) Testing.\n\n6) Troubleshooting. Not just the code, but also network issues, software issues (docker...), reverse engineering of that shitty API my code has to interact with...\n\n7) Coding. And I have to adapt to the current code base and style, try to find the right way and the right place to implement that new functionality, sometimes I end up re-writing a lot of code just so the functionality I am coding fits in nicely and cleanly. In that regard, GTP style tools can be really useful, they save a lot of time for repetitive tasks, but they are really bad for learning.\n\nVery little of that are things you can learn via the typical coding course. Now I am not trying to discourage anyone, being a dev can feel very rewarding, but be aware that there is much more to it than Codility challenges (they are mostly useful for the interview part).\n\nSo what can you do?\n\nA) Find an open source project you are interested in, go through the code, try to understand how it works (use a debugger or add print() to see what that portion of code does or if it gets executed at all), maybe even submit pull requests and use the feedback to improve.\n\nB) Be a nerd, find your own projects. Right now I am working on a way to use a midi controller connected to a Raspberry Pi to send commands to my Windows PC, this involves networking analysis, learning the midi protocol, Linux, finding the right tools on the Windows side (and if I can't find one I like, creating my own, which will likely involve other languages). It is ok if you can't finish your project because you hit a wall. You'll probably learn a lot on the way and you can always come back to it later. At the very least, it will give you ideas of what else you could learn and where your weaknesses are.\n\nC) Invite other beginners to your project. If you have a cool project in mind, other beginners who are lost will be happy to join  you. It will teach you collaborative work and source control and it will be motivating. Sure, your code will be ugly at the beginning, but everyone starts there and the more code you write, the more you will understand what makes good code good.\n\nD) Explore other topics like networking and Linux. You don't have to be an expert but, especially if you do not have any IT background which seems to be the case quite often, you need to know the basics.\n\nE) Avoid GPT. And if you have no other choice than using GPT, do not copy/paste the code. Read it, understand it, maybe write down what it does, close GPT, and write your own code. \n\nF) Leave your ego at the door. Many (all) devs are \\*ssholes with inflated egos, myself included. If you can't take being a punching ball for some other dev every once in a while, you are going to have a hard time.\n\nHopefully this will help some beginners understand what they need to work on if they want to land a job.

Right now tho, I'm getting onto the frustrating projects (at least for me as a begginer) from the book and it seems I can't find a solution to continue.

The serial data is basically from the UART (with baud rate set to 921,600), where each packet is 76 bytes long, and packets are being sent at the rate of 800 packets per second. In my Python program, this is implemented by calling the read() function of Serial as read(76). However, I am seeing that after receiving a few hundred packets, one of the packets is missing a few bytes in the middle. Any idea why this might be happening?\n\nNow, to debug the above issue, I added a print statement just before my read() function. So it looks like:\n\n            self.serialInst = serial.Serial(self.COM_PORT, BAUD_RATE, bytesize=8, timeout=0.4)\n            .......\n            .......\n            print(\"\\nin_waiting = \" + str(self.serialInst.in_waiting), file = self.dbgFile)\n            packet = self.serialInst.read(76)\n            # then print the bytes of the packet received\n\nIn the output that is printed, I see that the value of `in_waiting` starts with a rather large number 3892 (when the first packet has been received). Then after each packet is received, I see the value reducing by 76 (most of the time).\n\n\nBelow is the output showing the last 3 packets, where the last packet is missing a few bytes (after 1b comes 3f). All the packets should have exactly same data (for this experimental run and output).\n\n-----------------------------\nin_waiting = 3896\n\n12 58 08 08 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3a 3b 3c 3d 3e 3f 40 41 42 43 44 45 01 ea\n\n\nin_waiting = 3820\n\n12 58 08 08 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3a 3b 3c 3d 3e 3f 40 41 42 43 44 45 01 ea\n\n\nin_waiting = 3744\n\n12 58 08 08 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a 1b 3f 40 41 42 43 44 45 01 ea 12 58 08 08 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e\n\n----------------------------\n\n\n\nSo my questions are...\n\n1.

A huge part of that is how you name your objects\u2026 everything in Python is an object.\n\nSo, what are your favorite variable names, and how does it change with context?\n\nTypically, I aim for variables that share the same number of characters when they are contextually related; this makes them look nice line after line. When using camel-case like `case_camel` and `case_snake` (sorry), I typically put the slow changing word in front. Aside from that, I aim for minimizing length while maximizing contextual meaning.\n\nWith situations like dict comprehension, I lean closer to minimal length because additional context is provided outside the comprehensions scope by the variable assigned to its result.\n\nOut of my own personal tradition, I like using `name` and `pretty_name` when differing between a typical reporting name versus a long official name. This is for record-style data though, like a dataclass.\n\nDo you have any traditional variable names? What sort of patterns do you follow?"}

I checked the course profile and we'll be taught Python.\n\nThe thing is I have absolutely 0 knowledge about Python. I did undergo a small 3 month course in python last year, but the best I was taught was creating programs in IDE using loops/lists and the decision making with operators. The closest I made to an application was a calculator that ran in the environment itself.\n\nI bought this book [Python for Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/Python-All-One-Dummies-Shovic/dp/1119557593) but I had trouble grasping what was taught. \n\nThen I thought maybe the best way would be to try using python and then learning as I go. I decided to try making a simple application. I discovered something called 'Kivvy' which is basically python for app development (?) but I had zero idea what was being done. Then I turned to YouTube for some basic videos. I went along the tutorials but the whole thing about self, __inni_(), classes, importing modules everything confused me so much. For example, when creating a program how would I know if I even need a module and that a module according to my needs even exists? I'm really confused and stressed that I'm going to be absolutely stumped once my uni starts \n\nSo I find myself turning to you guys for advice/help. I have roughly 75-80 days, and I am currently unemployed so I have all the time in the day. What should be my best course of action? Videos on social media are confusing me even more, something about leetcoding, some say I should make projects for a portfolio, some say I should start again since I'm forgetting the basics. Nobody in my family has a coding experience that I can turn to. Any resources should I refer to? Any recommendations? Any suggestions about a workplan I should follow?I'm REALLY DESPERATE. Any advice or help is greatly appreciated! !"}

However, I have noticed something strange -  when creating a weakref it seems as though the reference cycles are just moved from the \"real\" object to the weakref. Is this a potential issue specifically as it relates to garbage collection of the weakref itself?\n\n  \nThe reasoning behind the question is this: In my application about 90% of the time there is no issue - it runs cleanly. But the other 10% of the time the program runs to completion, but then appears to hang at what I expect is the final process teardown/collection. I anticipate that circular references might be the culprit - preventing things from resolving cleanly. So, I would naturally use weakrefs to break up the cycle.

Then I want an evaluation script or data preprocessing scripts, placed in ./evaluation/ and ./data/. It seems convenient to place the entry points for each into these subfolders for organization rather than at the root. However the imports are not relative, unlike in nodejs, for example, making it difficult to import stuff from other places in these files, unless I modify it the path with os/sys or run them as modules.

I definitely need this feature as there is no solving this problem without that logic.\n\nAs a result, I researched further and tried to use Python's built-in `collections.deque` object instead of list but to no avail. It turned out to be as inefficient as the list!\n\nNot losing hope even after that, I decided to implement my own `LinkedList` class as follows:\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, data):\n            self.data = data  # Assigns the given data to the node\n            self.next = None  # Initialize the next attribute to null\n\n    class LinkedList:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.head = None  # Initialize head as None\n            \n        def insertAt(self, idx, data):\n            if not self.head: # empty head, append at start\n                self.head = Node(data)\n                return\n            temp, i = self.head, 0\n            endNode = None\n            while i < idx:\n                if temp.next == None: endNode = temp\n                temp = temp.next\n                i += 1\n            if temp == None:\n                n = Node(data)\n                endNode.next = n\n            else:\n                n = Node(temp.data)\n                n.next = temp.next\n                temp.data = data\n                temp.next= n\n                \n        def removeAt(self, idx):\n            p, n, i = None, self.head, 0\n            while i < idx:\n                p = n\n                n = n.next\n                i += 1\n            if idx == 0 and n:\n                if not n.next:\n                    self.head = None\n                else:\n                    self.head = n.next\n            elif p:\n                p.next = n.next\n                n = None # delete\n            else: # zero node\n                self.head = n\n                \n        def printAll(self):\n            temp = self.head\n            while temp:\n                print(temp.data, end='')\n                temp = temp.next\n            print(\"\")\n            \n            \n        def __repr__(self):\n            temp = self.head # Start from the head of the list\n            ss = ''\n            while temp:\n                ss += temp.data + \"=>\"\n                temp = temp.next # Move to the next node\n            return ss\n\n    out = LinkedList() #deque() #[] #[\"\" for x in range(len(line))]\n    #sout = \"\"\n    idx, n = 0, 0\n    for c in input():\n        if c == 'L':\n            idx -= 1\n        elif c == 'R':\n            idx += 1\n        elif c == 'B' and idx > 0:\n            idx -= 1\n            #out.pop(idx)\n            #del out[idx]\n            out.removeAt(idx)\n            n -= 1\n        else:\n            #out.insert(idx, c)\n            out.insertAt(idx, c)\n            n += 1\n            idx += 1\n\n    #print(''.join(out))\n    out.printAll()\n\nSadly, this turned out to be even more inefficient than the list! Though in theory, it is supposed to be faster as it takes only O(N) complexity instead of O(N^2) of list.\n\nI've tried all known options at this point. Unless you can come up with a better LinkedList implementation than this, the only conclusion here is that the language itself (Python3) is incapable here of passing this test. \n\nI'm reasonably sure that Java and PHP versions of this program should crack this evaluation, given the exact same logic and time complexity.\n\n**Edit**\n\nSpecial thanks to /u/qazbarf  and /u/schoolmonky - your idea of having two separate lists for the left and right sides of the cursor works superbly! Since the `deque` object has special methods called `appendleft` and `popleft` for this exact kind of scenario, I re-implemented the algorithm as follows and it got accepted:\n\n    from collections import deque\n\n    l, r = deque(), deque()\n    idx, n = 0, 0\n    for c in input():\n        if c == 'L':\n            item = l.pop()\n            r.appendleft(item)\n        elif c == 'R':\n            item = r.popleft()\n            l.append(item)\n        elif c == 'B':\n            l.pop()\n        else:\n            l.append(c)\n\n    print(\"\".join(l) + \"\".join(r))"}

I have this main script which will ask the user to select the scenario and start sending packets and 2 other scripts one collects logs and another to run sniffer. i crated the first script so that while running, it will open two new terminals and start running the other two scripts.\n\nThe issue that am facing right now is that i have added code so that a user interrupt or keyboard interrupt happens the script will ask the user to run the code again or not, when this happens my other two terminals are getting closed. I don't know why when i run the code for the first time there was no issue it asked to run again and other two terminals stayed open. Need help in debugging the issue and if possible to optimize with reliable code format.\n\nI have to run this code in 3 terminal because i am sending packets in an infinite loop and if possible i need to make it run all this in one terminal.\n\nwhen running sniffer the terminal goes in to an interactive mode so the rest of the code was not executing that's why i wrote 3 scripts individually.

However, when I run the script in the terminal, I find myself having to manually close the plot display (that you get from `plt.show()`) before the script continues.\n\nSo I've worked out how to tell if a script is running interactively or not, so I can do something like `if interactive: <plot figure>` for each figure individually. But I wonder - is there a way to set this condition at the start of the script to apply to all the figures?\n\nConsider either or both or the following scenarios:\n- Only plot figures when running interactively.\n- Always plot figures. If interactive: show but don't save figures. If not interactive: save figures but don't show them.\n\nThanks!"}

There must be an easier way to run all of these values through the test. My solution was to define the BATCHTEST function to run 9 values at once through the test, so I don't have to do it 27 times in the code. I suspect there may be a better way to do this, however.\n\n\n\nAny feedback or advice would be appreciated."}

Envision a scenario where a natural language text generation model, fine-tuned to compose and invoke malicious code, could autonomously propagate itself based on system specifications and contextual cues. The ramifications of such a capability are profoundly unsettling.\n\nI've contemplated the notion of adjusting the model's architecture to include a malicious code detection mechanism, thereby rendering it impervious to exploitation by individuals with malicious intent.

For example, if I have a Python function like this:\n\n    def print_sum(a: int, b: int, c: int):\n        result = sum([a, b, c])\n    print(result)\n    return result\n\nMy ideal, best of all worlds outcomes would be that there is some relatively straightforward way for me to generate the C++ binding code so that in my C++ code, I can call it like so (after initializing the Python interpreter of course):\n\n    my_dummy_module.print_sum(1, 2, 3);\n\nIdeally, I would just throw a decorator onto the classes and functions I want exposed to C++, run a command to generate the corresponding C++ code and be done with it\n\nI wrote a quick prototype decorator `expose_function`  that uses the inspect module to look at the type annotations and store the relevant information about the function names and type signature, and then I can use that to generate C++ code that looks like this:\n\nheader:\n\n    class my_dummy_module{\n      public: my_dummy_module() : object_(pybind11::module_::import(\"my_dummy_module\")) {}\n      int print_sum(int a, int b, int c);\n    private:\n      ::pybind11::object object_;\n    };\n\nsource:\n\n    int my_dummy_module::print_sum(int a, int b, int c) {\n      pybind11::object attr = object_.attr(\"print_sum\");\n      return attr(a, b, c).cast<int>();\n    }\n\nI got about that far before I figured that someone must have already built something like this, so before I go any further building this tool I want to make sure I'm not missing anything to make these kinds of bindings easier.\n\nCython looks close to what I want, but it requires I maintain some additional cython binding files. I see that there's some cython decorators that you can just drop into regular python code that seem close. On [this page](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html) they give this example:\n\n    @cython.cfunc\n    @cython.returns(cython.bint)\n    @cython.locals(a=cython.int, b=cython.int)\n    def c_compare(a,b):\n        return a == b\n\nBut if you have the types on your function annotated it seems like it ought to be possible to have the function decorator infer those types instead of needing to explicitly declare them. Also while I was able to get it to generate a header and source file for a cython file (\\*.pyx extension) I couldn't figure out how to get it to generate the same files from a pure-python-with-cython-decorators file. I might just be overlooking something from the docs or calling it with the wrong command line flags but I can't figure it out.\n\nI also see that there's the mypyc which seems like something else that's in the ballpark of what I want, and it uses the standard mypy type annotations that I already have in place so I wouldn't need to switch to using cython's alternate type annotations, but I likewise can't figure out how to get it to spit out C++ header and source files from the python files it consumes. I can get it to spit out a .so file, but I want to have a generated header as well."}

Thank you.\n\n\n\n    import pygame\n    \n    background = pygame.image.load('skybackground.jpg').convert()\n\n    SCR_WID, SCR_HEI = 640, 480\n    \n     class Player():\n     _counter = 0 \n    def init(self, x, num):\n     Player._counter += 1 \n    self.id = Player._counter\n     self.num = num \n    self.x, self.y = x, SCR_HEI/2\n     self.speed = 3 \n    self.padWid, self.padHei = 8, 64\n     self.score = 0\n     self.score2 = 0\n     self.scoreFont = pygame.font.SysFont(\"imagine_font.ttf\", 64) print (Player._counter)\n\n        def scoring(self):\n                scoreBlit = self.scoreFont.render(str(self.score), 1, (255, 255, 255))\n                screen.blit(scoreBlit, (32, 16))\n                if self.score == 10:\n                        print (\"player 1 wins!\")\n                        exit()\n    \n                scoreBlit = self.scoreFont.render(str(self.score2), 1, (255, 255, 255))\n                screen.blit(scoreBlit, (SCR_HEI+92, 16))\n                if self.score2 == 10:\n                        print (\"Player 2 wins!\")\n                        exit()\n       \n        def movement(self):\n                keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()\n                if self.num == 1:\n                        if keys[pygame.K_w]:\n                                self.y -= self.speed\n                        elif keys[pygame.K_s]:\n                                self.y += self.speed\n               \n                        if self.y <= 0:\n                                self.y = 0\n                        elif self.y >= SCR_HEI-64:\n                                self.y = SCR_HEI-64\n                        \n    \n                if self.num == 2:\n                        if keys[pygame.K_UP]:\n                                self.y -= self.speed\n                        elif keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:\n                                self.y += self.speed\n       \n                        if self.y <= 0:\n                                self.y = 0\n                        elif self.y >= SCR_HEI-64:\n                                self.y = SCR_HEI-64\n       \n        def draw(self):\n                pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 255, 255), (self.x, self.y, self.padWid, self.padHei))\n\n    class Ball():\n     def init(self):\n     self.x, self.y = SCR_WID/2, SCR_HEI/2 \n    self.speed_x = -3 \n    self.speed_y = 3 \n    self.size = 8\n\n        def movement(self):\n                self.x += self.speed_x\n                self.y += self.speed_y\n    \n                #wall col\n                if self.y <= 0:\n                        self.speed_y *= -1\n                elif self.y >= SCR_HEI-self.size:\n                        self.speed_y *= -1\n    \n                if self.x <= 0:\n                        self.__init__()\n                        player.score2 += 1\n                elif self.x >= SCR_WID-self.size:\n                        self.__init__()\n                        self.speed_x = 3\n                        player.score += 1\n                ##wall col\n                #paddle col\n                #player\n                for n in range(-self.size, player.padHei):\n                        if self.y == player.y + n:\n                                if self.x <= player.x + player.padWid:\n                                        self.speed_x *= -1\n                                        break\n                        n += 1\n                #enemy\n                for n in range(-self.size, enemy.padHei):\n                        if self.y == enemy.y + n:\n                                if self.x >= enemy.x - enemy.padWid:\n                                        self.speed_x *= -1\n                                        break\n                        n += 1\n                ##paddle col\n    \n        def draw(self):\n                pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 255, 255), (self.x, self.y, 8, 8))\n\n    SCR_WID, SCR_HEI = 640, 480\n     screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCR_WID, SCR_HEI))\n     pygame.display.set_caption(\"Pong\")\n     pygame.font.init()\n     clock = pygame.time.Clock()\n     FPS = 60\n    \n    player = Player(16, 1)\n     ball = Ball()\n    player = Player()\n    enemy = Player(624, 2)\n     def main(): \n    while True:\n     #process\n     for event in pygame.event.get():\n     if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n     print (\"Game exited by user\")\n     exit()\n    \n     ##process\n     #logic\n     ball.movement()\n     player.movement()\n     enemy.movement()\n     ##logic\n     #draw\n     screen.fill((0, 0, 0))\n     ball.draw()\n     player.draw()\n     player.scoring()\n     enemy.draw()\n     ##draw\n     #_______\n     pygame.display.flip() \n    clock.tick(FPS)\n    \n    main()\n    "}

I've mostly been using video tutorials, but I keep getting distracted or losing interest before finishing them. Recently, I've heard that learning from documentation can be more effective in the long run.\n\nI'm interested in giving documentation a try, but I'm not sure where to start or how to do it well. That's why I'm reaching out to this community for some advice.\n\nSpecifically, I want to learn how to work with different stop timers in different rows using data from a CSV timeline file. I'd like to dive right into a project involving this functionality, but I'm not sure if it's realistic to learn solely from documentation and then apply that knowledge directly to a project.\n\nIf anyone has experience transitioning from video tutorials to documentation-based learning, I'd really appreciate your tips and suggestions. And if you know of any resources or recommended documentation for learning about stop timers and manipulating CSV files, please share them!\n\nThank you so much for your help and guidance. I'm excited to try this new approach to learning and hopefully make some progress towards my goals."}

Like, if I compile with CMake and I want to include some header files that are somewhere else I can tell the compiler where to find those other header files. I've seen some questions that were saying to modify sys.path, but also many people not recommending doing it.\n\nI'm really just confused why Python would not keep modules relative: if I want to import from a module that is in the directory before the one I'm calling from, why not just check that that directory exists and that it is a module and then let me use it?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nOkay, so I was writing this yesterday evening, but then Reddit decided to delete all my edit and I hadn't had the time to write it all again. \n\nBasically I was doing two errors. The first is the main one and is something that was not clear to me at all, and that is the difference between script and module. Even though now that I think about it is obvious, I'm still not 100% sure I understand why some cases do not work as I intend them to do. \n\nBefore getting to it, I \"understood\" my mistakes because I was following [u/Buttleston](https://www.reddit.com/user/Buttleston/) suggestion of creating a [repo](https://www.github.com/myoses/pythontest/) to share my problem. Obviously before uploading it, I had to test if everything was not working as intended, but I found out that it actually was not not working as intended.\n\nThe repo structure is as follows:\n\n```text\npythontest\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 mod1 \n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __main__.py\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Mod1.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 mod2 \n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 mod3 \n        \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Mod3.py\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 Mod2.py\n```\n\nEach `Mod*.py` has a class with the same name and my goal is to use the `Mod3` class inside of the `Mod1` class. The `main.py` _script_ in the main folder is to test that I can safely import everything and run everything smoothly.\n\nSo inside `Mod1.py` I have the instruction to import the `mod3` _module_:\n\n```python\nfrom mod2.mod3.Mod3 import Mod3\n```\n\nIf we run `python3 main.py`, this works without any problem, but we already knew that this was going to work because we are calling the script from within the same directory and the modules are placed inside the same directory, so there is no reason that it should not work. \n\nLet's stick for a second to scripting to understand where all my problems came from. Let's add the following to `Mod1.py`:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    Mod1()\n```\n\nSo now, if we consider `Mod1.py` as a _script_, we should be able to execute it without problems, but lo and behold, this is not the case, because it is a _script_:\n\n```bash\npython3 mod1/Mod1.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/user/pythontest/mod1/Mod1.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from mod2.mod3.Mod3 import Mod3\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mod2'\n```\n\nI'm still not 100% sure why this should not work since I'm still calling the script from the main directory, but I reckon that when calling a script with something like `dir/script.py` the actual directory from which it is called is actually `dir`, and hence it won't see the modules that are outside of `dir`. \n\nIndeed, if we move inside the `mod1` directory and call the `Mod1.py` script, we do not expect it to work and it returns the same exact error: \n\n```bash\npython3 Mod1.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/user/pythontest/mod1/Mod1.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from mod2.mod3.Mod3 import Mod3\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mod2'\n```\n\nOkay, so let's consider `Mod1` as a module! Let's add a `__main__.py` file in which we put the same invocation as before: \n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    Mod1()\n```\n\nand let's go back to the main directory (`pythontest`). Now we can run the module by executing:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m mod1\n```\n\nAnd it works perfectly, because we are indeed considering the _module_ as a _module_.\n\nFinal thing that is not clear to me. I would expect that by exiting `pythontest` I should be able to call the `mod1` module by executing:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m pythontest.mod1\n```\n\nBut this is not working and returns the error:\n\n```text\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mod2'Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py\", line 196, in _run_module_as_main\n    return _run_code(code, main_globals, None,\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py\", line 86, in _run_code\n    exec(code, run_globals)\n  File \"/home/user/pythontest/mod1/__main__.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from .Mod1 import Mod1\n  File \"/home/user/pythontest/mod1/Mod1.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from mod2.mod3.Mod3 import Mod3\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mod2'\n```\n\nObviously I had to check whether by changing the import to \n\n```python\nfrom pythontest.mod1.mod2.Mod3 import Mod3\n```\n\nit would have worked, and obviously it did! So I wondered, what if I put it relative? But now it becomes even more strange! If I write: \n\n```python\nfrom .mod2.mod3.Mod3 import Mod3\n```\n\nSo we say that from `mod1` the interpreter should look in the same directory for `mod2`, but we obtain the following error:\n\n```\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mod2'Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py\", line 196, in _run_module_as_main\n    return _run_code(code, main_globals, None,\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py\", line 86, in _run_code\n    exec(code, run_globals)\n  File \"/home/user/pythontest/mod1/__main__.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from .Mod1 import Mod1\n  File \"/home/user/pythontest/mod1/Mod1.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from .mod2.mod3.Mod3 import Mod3\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pythontest.mod1.mod2'\n```\n\nAnd then it dawned on me: why is it `No module named 'pythontest.mod1.mod2'`? Why `pythontest.mod1.mod2` and not `pythontest.mod2`? Well because we have said before that the modules are looked from the script (or module) that tries to find them, so in this case when we are in `pythontest.mod1.Mod1` and we say `from .mod2 ...` we are saying to look inside `mod1` for `mod2`. \n\nAnd indeed, by changing the import to \n\n```python\nfrom ..mod2.mod3.Mod3 import Mod3\n```\n\nwe fix the problem. YOU MAY think that this is the end, but unfortunately it is not. \nIf we enter again `pythontest` and run `python3 -m mod1` I should well expect that this works, and why should it not? Obviously it does not: \n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py\", line 196, in _run_module_as_main\n    return _run_code(code, main_globals, None,\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py\", line 86, in _run_code\n    exec(code, run_globals)\n  File \"/home/enrico/pythontest/mod1/__main__.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from .Mod1 import Mod1\n  File \"/home/enrico/pythontest/mod1/Mod1.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from ..mod2.mod3.Mod3 import Mod3\nImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package\n```\n\nSo the point is that to correctly import a module it matters from where you are executing the script/module.

I\u00b4m learning to use lists, so here I\u00b4m trying to evaluate how many times a result (no matter what) is repeated (3 times lets say) from a random generated-list of 0-1 values.\n\nMy idea was start from position 2 in the list and verify if the number in that position is the same with the previous position number and the previous to that (lets say position 2, position 1 and position 0), like a mobile block that evaluates 3 items from position 2 to the last position.\n\nMy code so far goes this way:\n\n    import random \n    results = [] \n    count = 0 \n    for i in range(14): \n        a = random.randint(0,1) \n        results.append(a) \n    print (results)\n    for n in results[2:]:\n        print (results[n-2], results[n-1],results[n]) #just to see what results are in \"my mobile block\"\n        if (results[n-2] == results[n-1] == results[n]): #here i\u00b4m trying to compare the items in the \"block\"\n            count= count + 1\n            print(count)\n\nAnd I got this:\n\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n    0 0 1\n    0 0 1\n    0 1 0\n    0 0 1\n    0 0 1\n    0 1 0\n    0 1 0\n    0 1 0\n    0 0 1\n    0 1 0\n    0 0 1\n    0 0 1\n\nwhere the first block (position 1, position 2 and position 3) have the same value but where it was supposed to showed (according to me) it prints 0 0 1 instead of 0 0 0.\n\nI already tried  with a known list and also have different output than the expected at the print in line 9\n\nWhat I\u00b4m doing wrong? I\u00b4m lost in here."}

Did I correctly make use of a class in this example?\n2. I know methods to achieve the same result with the same amount of code, without using classes, so what is the purpose of using classes then?\n\nI could for example do this:\n\n    #defining:\n    age = 1   #1 as in: second item of the list.\n    def cakeday(x):\n      x[age] += 1\n    \n    #making use of:\n    new_user1 = ['catboy', 0]\n    cakeday(new_user) \n\nWhich has way less code and seems more logical/simple to me but achieves the same result.\n\nAre classes really optional as in, you can be a real programmer without using them?

This schema allows for a user to filter emails based on rules on different fields of an email like Subject, Content, From etc. Following this, the user can specify whether an email should be filtered if it obeys all rules or any one or more. Also, the user can specify one of a (limited) set of actions like - Mark the email as read/unread, Move the email (to inbox)  \nI am using sqlite to store the fetched emails and OAuth2 to authenticate and use the Gmail API. Then, the user provided rules.json is parsed and checked if i) it is semantically correct as per the schema and ii) executes the rules defined in this json against the fetched emails  \nRight now, this tool is not in a useable state as I have removed the hardcoded credentials.json which I had left in for easy reproducability for any evaluator from the company which had set this assignment. I know that the ideal way to go about this is to add credentials into the environment.Also, I have a bunch of print statements left in the code which should be removed or replaced with logging. Apart from this, I'd like to know if you guys have any suggestions for the code itself? In what ways can I improve the code or make it more Pythonic? Any suggestions on the design patterns used(specifically Strategy for applying rules and Singleton otherwise in multiple places)  \nI'd appreciate any feedback on this work. Thanks!"}

I'm seeing that the predictions for a very simple data-generating process and model seem to be one-period off?\n\nI start by generating\u00a0`Y`, a simple AR(1) process:\n\nY(t) = phi\\*Y(t-1) + epsilon(t), where Y(0)=0, phi=0.5, and epsilon\\~N(0,1)\n\ni.e.\n\n    import numpy\n    N = 100 Epsilon = numpy.random.normal(0,1,size=N) phi = 0.5 y0 = 0 Y = [y0] for t in range(1,N): Y.append(phi*Y[t-1] + Epsilon[t]) Y = numpy.array(Y)\n\nThis process is already stationary, and thus no integration order is required, motivating an ARIMA(1,0,0) model:\n\n    from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX\n    model = SARIMAX(endog=Y,order=(1,0,0),trend='n')\n    results = model.fit(disp=0,maxiter=5000) Y_hat = results.predict(start=0,end=N+1) data = pandas.concat([ pandas.DataFrame(Y), pandas.DataFrame(Y_hat) ],axis=1) data.columns = ['Y','Y_hat']\n    data['lead1_Y_hat'] = data['Y_hat'].shift(-1)  # to illustrate point about shifting\n\nPrinting the results:\n\n    print(data.iloc[0:10])\n\nY     Y\\_hat  lead1\\_Y\\_hat\n\n0   0.000000  0.000000     0.000000\n\n1   1.541240  0.000000     0.720830\n\n2   2.193788  0.720830     1.026024\n\n3   1.872597  1.026024     0.875804\n\n4   0.570133  0.875804     0.266648\n\n5  -0.584309  0.266648    -0.273279\n\n6   0.053699 -0.273279     0.025115\n\n7  -0.625234  0.025115    -0.292419\n\n8  -0.652084 -0.292419    -0.304977\n\n9  -0.986601 -0.304977    -0.461428\n\n10 -1.213017 -0.461428    -0.567322\n\nAnd the model summary:\n\n    print(results.summary())\n\nIndicates that the model did a decent job estimating phi (true value = 0.5, estimate is 0.4677 \\[0.290,0.645\\]).\n\nHowever, when I compute the within-sample RMSE (either through\u00a0`scikit-learn`\u00a0or\u00a0`SARIMAX`'s native implementation):\n\n    print('RMSE from sklearn',root_mean_squared_error(data.iloc[0:-2]['Y'],data.iloc[0:-2]['Y_hat'])\n    print('RMSE from SARIMAX',numpy.sqrt(results.mse))\n    # RMSE from sklearn 0.9926951086389326\n    # RMSE from SARIMAX 0.9926951086389326\n\nI find that the model unambiguously, always performs better if I shift look at the predictions one-period ahead:\n\n    print('RMSE using lead1',root_mean_squared_error(data.iloc[0:-2]['Y'],data.iloc[0:-2]['lead1_Y_hat']))\n    # RMSE using lead1 0.5980186682488163\n\nI understand that I have specified a very simple AR(1) model; as such, the prediction is merely a response to whatever the realized value was last period, times phi. From inspecting the graph of the data, it appears that the forecasted peaks and troughs are almost always off by one period. On that note, I have two questions:\n\n1. Is it valid to simply shift the predictions backward one period, i.e. use the\u00a0`lead1_Y_hat`\u00a0as defined above?\n2. If it is not valid to do this, how can I get it to predict the peaks & troughs better? I understand that in my data-generating process, the only thing that causes y to move, apart from the AR(1) parameter which has been estimated, is a fundamentally un-estimable white noise component. Does that mean we can't do any better than what was done?\n\nThank you for any insights!"}

(Very important, and related to above question) if I decide to only do side jobs/freelance/projects, are there a lot of opportunities for that (i.e., pen testing gigs, gigs requiring programming), and what is the level of autonomy?

{"title": "Python Multiprocessing", "score": 7, "id": "1c4vxiw", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1c4vxiw/python_multiprocessing/", "num_comments": 11, "body": "For my masters thesis I need to create a gui application that controls and displays data for a bunch of stepper motors (via pyserial) and some measuring devices (via pyvisa using pyvisa-py as a backend).\n\nI am using the niceGUI library as it is simple and web based (want to control via browser from any device). The problem I am currently facing is that the whole application is starting to get a bit laggy. I have used a lot of asynchronous functions to control the motors and to get position data from the motors and other devices running \"simultaneously\". This led to an overall reduced data acquisition (fewer data points, which is bad as I am trying to record accurate position data) and laggy gui as the interpreter (I think, might be wrong tho) has to jump around a lot as I am doing a lot of async stuff (motor control, fetch data, refresh plotly-plot in gui, update labels in gui ... etc).\n\nI have tried to use multiprocessing or multithreading to solve the problem, but I am reaching the limits of what I know about programming and would like to ask for advice. When i tried to use multiprocessing i often ran into the error that the function i tried to execute was not pickable. Another problem I had was that I could not control the motor and get position data in separate processes because the serial connection could only be opened once...\n\nI then tried to move the control and data acquisition of each motor to a separate process and have multiple processes for each motor. This seems to work but I am really not sure if this is the right way to do it. What I have tried is to have a separate class that handles the connection and has a listener that runs in an infinite loop and listens for commands through a pipe:\n\n    import asyncio\n    import time\n    from multiprocessing import Process, Pipe\n    from multiprocessing.connection import Connection\n    \n    class MotorControl:\n        def __init__(self, pipe: Connection):\n            self.pipe = pipe\n            self.rotating = False\n            self.collected_data:list[int] = []\n    \n            # here i would also initialize and connect to the motor\n    \n            asyncio.run(self.listen_for_commands())\n    \n        async def listen_for_commands(self):\n            print('waiting for command...')\n            while True:\n                # Receive command from the main process\n                command = self.pipe.recv()\n                # Execute command\n                if command == 'execute_command':\n                    self.execute_command()\n                elif command == 'another_command':\n                    self.another_command()\n                elif command == 'do_rotation':\n                    await self.do_rotation()\n                elif command == 'exit':\n                    break\n                else:\n                    print('Unknown command')\n    \n        def execute_command(self):\n            print('executed command')\n        \n        def another_command(self):\n            print('executed another command')\n    \n        async def rotate(self):\n            print('rotating')\n            self.rotating = True\n            start = time.time()\n            await asyncio.sleep(2)\n            end = time.time()\n            print(f'rotated for {end - start} seconds')\n            self.rotating = False\n            print('rotated')\n        \n        async def acquire_data(self):\n            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)\n            i = 0\n            while self.rotating:\n                i += 1\n                self.collected_data.append(i)\n    \n                await asyncio.sleep(0.0001)\n    \n                if len(self.collected_data) % 100 ==0:\n                    print('sending data...')\n                    self.pipe.send(self.collected_data)\n    \n            self.pipe.send(self.collected_data)\n    \n        async def do_rotation(self):\n            await asyncio.gather(self.rotate(), self.acquire_data())\n    \n    def init_class(class_pipe):\n        classA = MotorControl(class_pipe)\n    \n    # this simulates a repetitive gui task that updates the plot\n    async def update_plot(my_pipe:Connection):\n        times_to_poll_empty_pipe = 5\n        times_polled = 0\n        while True:\n            print('updating plot')\n            await asyncio.sleep(0.5) # update plot every 0.5 seconds\n            if my_pipe.poll():\n                while my_pipe.poll():\n                    data = my_pipe.recv()\n                times_polled = 0\n                print(f'data: {data}') # simulate updating plot\n                print('length of data:', len(data))\n            else:\n                if times_polled < times_to_poll_empty_pipe:\n                    times_polled += 1\n                    print('polling empty pipe')\n                    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)\n                else:\n                    break\n            print('plot updated')\n    \n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n    \n        my_pipe, class_pipe = Pipe()\n        class_process = Process(target=init_class, args=(class_pipe,))\n        class_process.start()\n    \n        time.sleep(2) # waiting before sending command\n    \n        my_pipe.send('do_rotation')\n    \n        # print out the data from the pipe as long as new data is being sent\n        asyncio.run(update_plot(my_pipe)) # use ui.timer to update stuff in gui\n    \n    \n        time.sleep(10)\n        print('sending exit command...')\n        my_pipe.send('exit')\n\nWhat do you think?

Before I start discussing about my project, I want to apologize in advance for any naive questions or incorrect use of terms, as I'm new to the field of machine learning and chatbots.\n\nNow, onto my question: I'm attempting to create a web app using React and Python (Flask) that integrates a chatbot designed to recommend personalized video games to users based on their queries. To elaborate, users will either talk about their all-time favorite video games, the genres/tags they are fond of, or provide a short description of their demographic profile (e.g., based on age and gender - the chatbot will go on to recommend the user video games from different genres that it thinks he/she will enjoy. There are some studies on the correlation between video games genres and gender/age of a person. I'm thinking of feeding my chatbot this kind of data from these sources, if possible).  Once the chatbot understands the query, it will make a call to an external API of a video game database to retrieve games that match the criteria. \n\nSo to reiterate, what I'm trying to do is to create a chatbot that understands user input, and based on the context extracted from that input, make calls to the external video games database API (such as RAWG), or to the knowledge base then to the external API, and fetch the suitable types of games that the chatbot see suitable to recommend.\n\nOne framework I've seen capable of perhaps achieving this, using JS and Python, is LangChain. Is it possible to accomplish all of this using LangChain? And is LangChain the right way to achieve this? If yes, how should I approach this? What factors should I consider while trying to implement my chatbot? What advice do you have for a beginner like me? Is there any other information I should add to my post? Or if not, what other APIs or frameworks can you recommend me looking into and eventually use?\n\nThank you a lot to everyone who took their time to read this and help me out!"}

I'm struggling to integrate the Child project as a submodule within the Parent due to Python not recognizing it as a sub-package. There seem to be a lot of ways to solve this, and I am trying to understand each of them better or find better ways to do it.\n\nI've been working on a large Python project for a couple of years. At first, it was just a mishmash of procedural scripts thrown together to form an application. Over time, I've refined it, transitioning significant portions into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), resulting in better performance, modularity, and just generally improving the maintainability.\n\nOriginally, everything was bundled into one extensive project. However, I've since split it into two: a Parent project and a Child project. The Child project isn't a standalone application; it's a collection of packages inheriting functionality from a shared base class, along with additional supporting code.\n\nWith increased Python usage at work, I've grown fond of the src-based project structure for Python applications. Consequently, I'm restructuring my Parent project accordingly (refer to the directory tree below).\n\nMy initial thought was to simply load in the Child project as a git submodule and store the Child\u2019s repo dir inside the src/ directory for the Parent. However, since the Child\u2019s git directory is itself not a package, the Parent Project does not detect the project as being a sub-package within the Parent.\n\nOff to Google I went to research and learn from the different ways to do this. There seems to be a myriad of different options to try. The three that seemed to all be good approaches:\n\n1. Simply add an \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py inside the ChildProjRepoDir to make pythPythonon see it as a packages- Simplest solution.\n2. Turn the ChildProj into an installable package using Poetry or *xyz* tool (seem to be many ways to do this).- Seems like a lot of work, but it will give me some learning experience going through the process of making installable packages.\n3. Create symlink to the Child dir inside the src/Parent/ dir and use sys and os to manipulate the Python path at runtime- In my limited experience this seems more of a hack than a solution.\n\nAre there better ways to do this that I have not seen yet?\n\nSome additional context: Both projects have their own git repos and I am using Poetry in both to manage dependencies. The shift from requirements.txt to Poetry is a recent one, and I am still learning about this approach.\n\nEdit: I don't know how to format the dir tree correctly, the indentations keep getting removed. [Here is a Pastebin link](https://pastebin.com/TQfn8SYv)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nParent/|-- main.py|-- readme.md|-- pyproject.toml|-- ...\\`-- src/|-- \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py\\`-- Parent/|-- \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py|-- other py files...|-- other subpackages...\\`-- ChildProjRepoDir/\\`-- Child/|-- \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py|-- SubPackageA/|   |-- \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py|   \\`-- py files...|-- ...\\`-- SubPackageD/|-- \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py\\`-- py files..."}

I am a super newbie and I'm in the last leg of a beginner Python course. My last assignment came back to me as failed because I had a never ending redundancies. I am redoing the assignment so I can just finish this course which is a requirement for a data analysis certification I'm working on for work. I don't even think I would ever be required to use python at work, but for the certification, I need this specific course. I have been able to mitigate most of the things the instructor mentioned. I am having a difficult time with one very specific thing. I have watched our course recording over and over, looked at 800 different websites, threads, and so on, and I just can not get it.\n\nI do not want the answer just thrown at me nor am I looking for a cheat on this assignment. I just wanted to reach out to those who know WAY more than me, to see if anyone could offer some guidance so I can finish this and hand it in.\n\nThe assignment was to take a txt story provided, read it in, all the parts in the story that say 'Square' need to be changed to 'Pentagon' and all the parts that say 'square', need to be changed to 'pentagon'. The story gets read, the relevant words are swapped, a new text file is saved. Once the words are swapped, the original story is supposed to be closed; the new story/file has an input which asks the user if they want to keep the file. User types Y or N and then the new story/file either saves or is deleted.\n\nI can do the majority. And have written and rewritten. The part I am struggling with, is the two words needing to be replaced with the two new words. I'm ok with ONE word, but trying to add the second one keeps returning errors like \"TypeError: 'in <string>' requires string as left operand, not list...\" or, I get one about indicing and slicing. I will attach a picture of what I'm doing. And where I would love some guidance or input. I struggled for hours previously and just added a second If statement which I failed for being redundant. Lol.\n\nI know this probably sounds ridiculously easy to fix but I am clearly not a coder, nor have hope to be one. I just want to get a non failing mark to move forward with my certification so ANY assistance would be so great. Thank you! I will attach a screenshot.\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/a/NF5jIlr)"}

I've learned core Python thoroughly and dipped my toes into web development by picking up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I've managed to create some simple projects, I've realized that I don't particularly enjoy frontend development. Instead, I'm drawn to solving problems on the backend and aspire to become a backend developer. My plan is to dive into Django since I already have a solid grasp of Python. However, I'm unsure if I'll need to be proficient in frontend development to effectively work with Django. Can someone clarify how backend development works? Is learning Django sufficient to build projects and pursue job opportunities in this field?"}

I am developing DBSCAN algorithm raw. my question is how I loop over the dictionary (the dictionary contains cluster numbers as keys and data points as values) as I add values and keys?\n\nI need to do this but python is not capable of it. I need to loop over as the data(values) is clustered in different clusters(keys) so the data that is examined can be compared to the dictionary that is constantly being added until the system goes over all the data.\n\nI read a lot of reddits and stack over flow postings and people suggesting making a copy for the original dictionary and loop over the copy of the original dictionary while changing the original dictionary. but this way, it is not going to loop over the dictionary that needs to be looped over while making its size bigger.\n\nIs there any way I can do this?\n\nThank you\n\n  \nI realized the problem in logic when it comes to iterating over the dictionary before the first loop is over. thanks for the help guys."}

Is it possible to assign dynamic ranges of values to variables based on user inputs? \n\nWhat I'm trying to do is compare the event times of different swimmers on a swim team. Each swimmer would, in my mind, be a variable with a number of values assigned to it. For example, swimmer one would be defined by: (name, Event Personal Records). Event Personal Records need to match a time to an event, for example, 30s on a 50Freestyle. The coach would input that StudentX can compete in the 50Free and swam a Personal Record 30s Free. \n\nMaybe something like:\n\nvariable student1-n = input1-ninputs(Name1-nnames, EPR1-nevents)\n\nBasically: Studet1 = Isobella, (50Free, 100Free, 100Fly), (30s, 60s, 62s). Where Isobella has 3 times for 3 events assigned to her, which I can perform math operations with later. \n\nAny help is appreciated, I've been googling around without much luck, so if anyone can point me in the right direction or tell me it's not possible that would be great.\n\nMaybe it would be better worded as defining a range of variables by an array or list of values, some of which have their own ranges.\n\nThank you!\n\nSolved: \n> Use lists, don't use \"variable variable names\". See https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_make_variable_variables.3F\n\n> For holding each swimmer, use a tuple or dict or class.\n\nThis was the part I was missing, I just need to figure out how to organize those against each other and I should be good to go, switching to dictionaries was a huge improvement."}

{"title": "How to use Popen to Capture Output from a Console Window (Windows OS)?", "score": 6, "id": "1c2gpkk", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1c2gpkk/how_to_use_popen_to_capture_output_from_a_console/", "num_comments": 5, "body": "I tried asking this question a few weeks ago on StackOverflow but got no response, so I figured I'd try it here.\n\nI am at wits end trying to find a solution to this, I've spent several hours trying to solve this and came up with nothing. The problem is fairly simple. I want to monitor stdout in **\\*\\*real time\\*\\*** from a console window (so [subprocess.run](http://subprocess.run) and subprocess.communicate(), or anything that blocks until the procedure is finished, are not options). I am using Windows systems so anything relying on Linux can't be used. Currently using Python 3.10\n\n**First Attempt:**\n\n    proc = subprocess.Popen(\n            ['launch', 'some', 'exe', 'file'],\n            cwd=\"some/directory\",\n            bufsize=0,\n            universal_newlines=True,\n            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\n            text=True,\n            stdin=subprocess.PIPE,\n            creationflags=CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE\n        )\n    \n        while True:\n            output = proc.stdout.readline()\n    \n            # Check if the output contains information about hitting a breakpoint\n            if 'Some Text' in output:\n                foo(var)\n                break\n            else:\n                print(output)\n\nNow, this works in the sense that the command runs, and I read the output in real time, and once 'Some Text' is found, foo runs. The problem is, the new console is blank, and the output is printed to the Python window, not the new console. This is because stdout = subprocess.PIPE 'steals' the output from the console Window. This does not work for my use case because the exe file is an interactive terminal that I need the user to interact with. I do not care about having them interact with the subprocess through Python, I need to capture the output so I know when to run foo.\n\n**Other Attempts:**\n\nSome of these will be more in depth than others. I will describe what I tried and why it hasn't worked.\n\n**Echo Terminal:**\n\nWhat I tried: Launching a thread that runs proc and launching proc2 on another thread. The idea was to echo proc.stdout (proc2.stdin = proc.stdout), and then accept user input and write it to proc.stdin.\n\nWhy it doesn't work: Writing to stdin blocks and I was unable to even get a simple echo statement to run. I didn't pursue this super in depth because my research indicated blocking would be a severe problem I'm fighting against the whole time.\n\n**Writng to sty.stdout:**\n\n    proc = subprocess.Popen(\n            ['launch', 'some', 'exe', 'file'],\n            cwd=\"some/directory\",\n            bufsize=0,\n            universal_newlines=True,\n            stdout=sys.stdout,\n            text=True,\n            creationflags=CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE\n        )\n\n\n\nWhat I tried: When setting stdout to sys.stdout, the process behaves as expected (outputs to the newly launched console window). My idea here was to then replace sys.stdout with a \"listener\" that has a write() method that writes to both the original sys.stdout and a new file stream.\n\nWhy it doesn't work: When Popen writes to sys.stdout, it doesn't call sys.stdout.write. Instead, it dumps it directly to the python.stdout file stream\n\n**Pipes:**\n\nWhat I tried: I tried a lot here. I tried directly accessing python sys.stdout and adding a pipe to the end of it. I've tried adding a Pipe to the start of sys.stdout and then passing it along. I've tried piping subprocess.stdout back in to the subprocess.stdin\n\nWhy it doesn't work: Honestly I've tried too much here to really go into detail, but I never even got close with any of them\n\n**Microsoft Python Libraries:**\n\nWhat I tried: Using Microsofts Python libraries to get the pid of the launched console and then directly write to it.\n\nWhy it doesn't work: To be honest I'm not sure, but I never made any type of progress with this method\n\n**GUI:**\n\nWhat I tried: This is probably the closest I've gotten to what I'm looking for. I created a super simple GUI that is supposed to mock a terminal.\n\nWhy it doesn't work: It's not that this doesn't work, per  say, but that it's a lot of effort. For example, when the user presses control + c (when the exe is not launched in Python), the program pauses (not terminate). Propagating ctr+c from the GUI to the subprocess is proving to be a problem. Further, this is just one functionality of a command window, and continuing down this path seems like a waste of effort for what (seems like) should be a fairly simple task.\n\n        proc = subprocess.Popen(\n            ['launch', 'some', 'exe', 'file'],\n            cwd=\"some/directory\",\n            bufsize=0,\n            universal_newlines=True,\n            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\n            stdin=subprocess.PIPE,\n            text=True,\n        )\n    \n        while True:\n            output = proc.stdout.readline()\n    \n            write_to_gui(output)\n\n\n\n**\\*\\*Final Thoughts\\*\\***\n\nI'm not sure if missing something, or if what I'm trying to do is impossible, but I feel like I should be able to do it. I'm open to any other suggestions or implementations for how to do this, but I really am at the end of my rope and haven't been able to find any resources to help with this. I'm including a rough diagram of the situation in case I wasn't clear somewhere. Thanks!\n\n[Link to Diagram](https://i.stack.imgur.com/D3ClE.jpg)"}

To start I just want to get the frame count and display it and have the indicator running while it figures it out.\n\nHere's my running process class, cribbed from the above article:\n\n    class RunningIndicator:\n        def __init__(self, msg='Running...', symbols='|/-\\\\'):\n            self.msg = msg\n            self.symbols = itertools.cycle(symbols)\n    \n        async def start(self):\n            while True:\n                sys.stdout.write('\\r' + self.msg + ' ' + next(self.symbols))\n                sys.stdout.flush()\n                await asyncio.sleep(0.1)\n    \n        async def stop(self):\n            sys.stdout.write('\\r')\n            sys.stdout.flush()\n\nHere's my class that will calculate the frame count and display it.  While it's running ffprobe, I'd like to have the 'Running....' indicator going as well:\n\n    class DVD_Process:\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 # Begin processing the source dvd\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 def __init__(self,dvd_source):\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 self.dvd_source = dvd_source\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 self.run()\n    \n    \u00a0 \u00a0 async def get_frames(self):\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 # Get number of frames in video file\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 dvd_source_properties = await subprocess.run(\".\\\\ffmpeg\\\\ffprobe -v quiet -count_frames -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=nb_read_frames -of default=nokey=1:noprint_wrappers=1 \" + self.dvd_source, capture_output=True, text=True)\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 dvd_source_frames = dvd_source_properties.stdout\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 print(\"Frames: \" + dvd_source_frames)\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 print()\n    \n    \u00a0 \u00a0 async def run(self):\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 running = RunningIndicator\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 running_task = asyncio.create_task(running.start()) \u00a0# Start loading indicator\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 await self.get_frames()\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 await running.stop()\n    \n\nI'm using input to get a file name and passing that in:\n\n    DVD_Process(dvd_source_file)\n    \n\nWhen I try and run I get the following error:\n\n    c:\\Projects\\Python\\test.py:91: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'DVD_Process.run' was never awaited\n      self.run()\n    RuntimeWarning: Enable tracemalloc to get the object allocation traceback\n\nI fully acknowledge that this is a bit above my pay grade, but I'm hoping someone can help me get it running. \n\nThanks in advance!"}

At some point, I got tired of the Drag-and-drop built into Windows, which works perfectly with the browser and explorer, I got tired of dragging 100 pictures into different folders per hour (programs for automatic downloading also don\u2019t suit me because I find pictures chaotically, and not from 1 site). I wanted to do everything in 1 click. There is probably an extension that allows you to download to the desired folder from the list, I didn\u2019t find it and decided to use the pyautogui and keyboard libraries. I programmed a little in CMD and in college in C#, they also wrote a js script for me (I was trying to figure it out). And half a year ago I wrote the bot I needed for physical work in python using GPT and now I decided to implement the program I needed, and recently I solved the problem of its sudden freezing, it turned out that the function of moving the mouse must be completely executed otherwise it will crash. This solved the problem:\n\n    def distance(point1, point2):\n    return math.sqrt((point1[0] - point2[0])**2 + (point1[1] - point2[1])**2)\n    def move_and_click_smooth(x, y, duration=0.3):\n    pyautogui.mouseDown()\n    pyautogui.moveTo(x, y, duration=duration)\n    while distance(pyautogui.position(), (x, y)) > 2000:  # Ignore distance to endpoint\n    time.sleep(0.2)\n    pyautogui.mouseUp()\n\nthis is how it works: [https://i.imgur.com/NbIi88c.png](https://i.imgur.com/NbIi88c.png)\n\nthe whole code is 102 lines, it simply doesn\u2019t fit here: [https://i.imgur.com/VGh58Ks.png](https://i.imgur.com/VGh58Ks.png) \n\nInitially, without any prompting, I realized that I needed to use variables and was able to implement a routine for making them at the beginning of the script. And I separately figured out how to write a mechanism for separating links and opening links from the clipboard, because I find many pictures from my phone and throw my favorites into the chat. When pasting from the phone's clipboard, the links appear in solid text.\n\n    def open_links_in_browser():\r\n    link = pyperclip.paste()\r\n    paragraphs = link.split('https://')\r\n    counter = 0  # Open link counter\r\n    \r\n    for paragraph in paragraphs:\r\n        url = \"https://\" + paragraph.strip()\r\n        if re.match(r'https?://(?:[-\\w.]|(?:%[\\da-fA-F]{2}))+', url):\r\n            webbrowser.open(url)\r\n            counter += 1  # Increment the counter for each open link\r\n    \r\n    print(f\"There were links: {counter}\")\n\n\r  \nIt was not possible to do without the re library, if you try to use webbrowser.open\\_new\\_tab(url) - Chrome simply ignores the settings and still opens links in a new window instead of new tabs. I also suggested something similar webbrowser.open(\"https://\" + paragraph.strip(), new=1) and subprocess.call(\\['start', 'chrome', url\\]) ... This is the same GPT hallucination, not the answer\n\nGithub I think it doesn\u2019t make sense to do this, most likely I didn\u2019t look well for a browser plugin for downloading to different folders.\r  \nThe next step is to try to implement another flag to return to the beginning of the script to redefine all folder coordinates. If it's not too difficult, I'll be happy to hear answers here\r  \nI know that there are much more flexible ways to do this kind of work, or you can just download a program for recording macros, but I wanted to completely assemble something myself.\n\nSorry for so much text. I'm just glad that I assembled such a combine, now I'm happy with everything. I\u2019m still sure that it will take another couple of years to write something like this in just one request."}
{"title": "Client - Server implementation on Python", "score": 2, "id": "1c284ei", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1c284ei/client_server_implementation_on_python/", "num_comments": 0, "body": "I've got an assignment to implement a server-client application which will implement a trivia contest.\n\nThe assignment:\n\n**Introduction**  \nYour objective is to write a client-server application which will implement a trivia contest. The players in this game get a random fact, which is either true or false, and are supposed to answer correctly as fast as possible.  \nEach team will write both a client application and a server application. Everybody\u2019s clients and servers are expected to work together with full compatibility.\n\n**Example Run**\n\n1. Team Mystic starts their server. The server prints out \u201cServer started, listening on IP address 172.1.0.4\u201d and starts automatically sending out \u201coffer\u201d announcements via UDP broadcast once every second.\n2. Players Alice, Bob and Charlie start their clients. The clients all print out \u201cClient started, listening for offer requests...\u201d. All of the clients get the offer announcement, extract the server name, and print out \u201cReceived offer from server \u201cMystic\u201d at address [172.1.0.4](http://172.1.0.4), attempting to connect...\u201d\n3. Each client connects to the Team Mystic server over TCP using the port specified in the ann. After the connection succeeds, each client sends the player name over the TCP connection, followed by a line break (\u2018\\\\n\u2019)\n4. After 10 seconds pass during which no additional player joins, the game begins - the server sends a welcome message to all of the clients with the names of the teams, followed by a statement which is either true or false. The answer to the question should be either Y,T,1 for true statements, or N,F,0 for false statements: Welcome to the Mystic server, where we are answering trivia questions about Aston Villa FC. Player 1: Alice Player 2: Bob Player 3: Charlie == True or false: Aston Villa's current manager is Pep Guardiola\n5. Every time the server sends the client a message over TCP, the client immediately prints it to the screen. The server also prints out this message to its own display. Every time the player types in a key, the client sends it to the server over TCP\n6. Each time the server receives a key over TCP, it checks the correctness of the answer: \u25cf If the answer is correct, the player wins immediately \u25cf If the answer is incorrect, the player is disqualified \u25cf If nobody answers after 10 seconds, or if all players answered incorrectly and were disqualified, the server chooses another random trivia question. The game finishes after 1 round, and the user who answers the correct answer first wins. Example output: Alice is correct! Alice wins!\n7. After the game is decided, the server sends a summary message to all players, for example: Game over! Congratulations to the winner: Charlie\n8. The server closes the TCP connection, prints on its own screen \u201cGame over, sending out offer requests...\u201d and goes back to sending offer messages once a second\n9. The clients print \u201cServer disconnected, listening for offer requests...\u201d and go back to waiting for offer messages\n\n**Suggested Architecture**  \nThe client is a single-threaded app, which has three states:  \n\u25cf Looking for a server. You leave this state when you get an offer message.  \n\u25cf Connecting to a server. You leave this state when you successfully connect using TCP  \n\u25cf Game mode - collect characters from the keyboard and send them over TCP. collect data from the network and print it on screen.  \nNote that in game mode the client responds to two events - both keyboard presses and data coming in over TCP. Think about how you can do this.\n\nThe server is multi-threaded since it has to manage multiple clients. It has two states:  \n\u25cf Waiting for clients - sending out offer messages and responding to request messages and new TCP connections. You leave this state after 10 seconds pass from the last time a user joined the game.  \n\u25cf Game mode - collect characters from the network and decide the winner. You leave this state after somebody wins the game.\n\n**Packet Formats**  \n\u25cf Servers broadcast their announcements with destination port 13117 using UDP. There is one packet format used for all UDP communications:  \n\u25cb Magic cookie (4 bytes): 0xabcddcba. The message is rejected if it doesn\u2019t start with this cookie  \n\u25cb Message type (1 byte): 0x2 for offer. No other message types are supported.  \n\u25cb Server name (32 character string, Unicode encoded): Think of a creative name. Make sure this field is always 32 characters long even if your server name is shorter.  \n\u25cb Server port (2 bytes): The port on the server that the client is supposed to connect to over TCP (the IP address of the server is the same for the UDP and TCP connections, so it doesn't need to be sent).  \n\u25cf The data over TCP has no packet format. After connecting, the client sends the predefined team name to the server, followed by a line break (\u2018\\\\n\u2019). After that, the client simply prints anything it gets from the server onscreen, and sends anything it gets from the keyboard to the server.  \n.  \n**Tips and Guidelines**  \n\u25cf Please pick a creative name for your players. The player name should be hard-coded into the program so it will start up quickly.  \n\u25cf Both server and client applications are supposed to run forever, until you quit them manually. You will not get full points if your program quits or crashes, even if it\u2019s because of some network-related problems.  \n\u25cf The server does not have to listen on any particular port over TCP, since this is part of the offer message. Think of how your code should respond if the first port you try to listen on is already used by somebody else  \n\u25cf Do not use busy-waiting (e.g. while-continue loops). As a general guideline, if your program consumes more than 1% CPU, you\u2019re probably doing something wrong.  \n\u25cf Think about what you should do if things fail - messages are corrupted, the server does not respond, the clients hang up, etc. Your error handling code will be tested.  \n\u25cf If you try to run two clients on the same computer, they won\u2019t be able to listen for broadcasts on the same UDP port unless you set the SO\\_REUSEPORT option when you open the socket, like this:\n\n>\n\nMy implementation so far:\n\n**Server:**\n\n    import queue\n    import struct\n    import psutil\n    import time\n    import random\n    import socket\n    import threading\n    from colorama import Fore, Style\n    import sys\n    \n    \n    class Server:\n        def __init__(self, ip_address=\"127.0.0.1\"):\n            self.statistics = {'total_rounds': 0, 'total_games': 0, 'total_players': 0, 'best_player': None}\n            self.players_score = {}\n            self.questions = [\n        (\"Alice falls down a rabbit hole to enter Wonderland.\", \"True\"),\n        (\"The Cheshire Cat's smile disappears first.\", \"False\"),\n        (\"The Queen of Hearts' favorite word is 'off with their heads!'\", \"True\"),\n        (\"The White Rabbit is always late.\", \"True\"),\n        (\"Alice's sister's name is Lily.\", \"False\"),\n        (\"The caterpillar smokes a hookah.\", \"True\"),\n        (\"The Mad Hatter hosts a tea party in the afternoon.\", \"False\"),\n        (\"The Dormouse sleeps at the tea party.\", \"True\"),\n        (\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was written by J.K.

I understand basic things such as giving a function only one purpose and if \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == \"\\_\\_main\\_\\_\" and calling other functions within main(), but some projects of mine just get so unbelievably messy and I am unsure what to do with them.   \n\n\nFor example, I am currently creating a GUI stopwatch in customtkinter. The code I am writing is based off of some OOP code, however I decided not to go the OOP route and instead am just using functions. This was working fine until I realized how many global calls I needed and how many parameters I kept adding to my functions, making what was originally neat code into a mess of argument calls spread throughout the functions. Not only that, but I also keep getting errors. So I know I need to change the code, and refactor it to fit functional programming better. I've been trying to wrap my head around how I should go about refactoring the code, but I find myself feeling lost and unsure where to even begin with refactoring.   \n\n\nI was wondering if there is any good resources on how to refactor code, more specifically Python code. The last thing I want is for my code to look like it was all written by chatGPT, and if I'm being honest, that's kind of what it's looking like right now. It's definitely an area I want to improve on, so any resources/advice would certainly be helpful! "}

I mean I REALLY know Python. You could hand me any Python script or directory and for the most part I'll get understand what's going on (bar maybe some machine learning or domain specific code).\n\nBut I have a weakness that I don't know how to overcome. I feel confident in my Python skills and building stuff locally, but when it comes to hosting a project, I ALWAYS feel intimidated in pretty much every form because of how many things there are to learn (of which I'm not fully certain) and I feel like I'm just one very small git push away from causing the whole thing to collapse ALL THE TIME.\n\nIt's one thing to make a script that can notify you via text every once in a while locally. It's another thing to host this script on some server and keep it running on a while loop. That doesn't work quite the same and from my understanding it uses more resources, which can equal more money.\n\nIt took me forever to learn how the hell to host a Django project on Heroku, and debugging it and getting all the correct settings to make it work.\n\nWith Railway it was easier but it still feels stressful because there are a lot of times when something breaks in production.\n\nI know that's what Docker is for, and maybe it's just how their official tutorial described stuff, but even with that I've run into situations that are intimidating (like trying to git pull a private github repository Python package without making some github private key as something public in that environment)\n\nThings that I see as difficult:\n\n* Making sure all the packages work on the uploaded environment\n* Making sure you don't get charged $100s to $1000s on Google Cloud Platform or AWS for a script with a while loop or a VM instance that doesn't turn off.\n* Dealing with so many hosting options\n* Dealing with Staticfile hosting and media uploads (like with S3) for example.\n* Database hosting\n* Hosting prices\n\nTo me it's like there's a whole nother world that feels like a black box.\n\nAlso, that hosting process on AWS and Railway still feels very flimsy and like it can break easily.\n\nI want to overcome this and feel like something is simple and makes sense and isn't just \"magic\".\n\n# 3 Simple Questions\n\n* What do I need to learn in order to make hosting not so confusing and feel confident that I can host pretty much anything cost effectively?\n* Where can I learn this stuff?\n* How do I make the process faster / easier across my different projects?"}

The goal is to analyse research data from a bunch of participants, which participated in a research experiment.\n\nMy idea was to write a ParticipantData class, which creates a new object for each participant in my experiment, and have a bunch of methods to run the different analysis I have in mind. Something like:\n\n    def parse_data(column_names: list) -> dict:\n        do_the_parsing()\n    \n    class ParticipantData:\n        def __init__(self, column_names):\n            self.data = parse_data(column_names)\n        def analyse_stuff(self):\n            do_the_analysing()\n\nI am aware that, besides methods, I can also define functions, which are basically not part of the class object. Is there any best-practice for when I put code in a function and when in a method? \n\nFor example, `parse_data` is a function. My rational was that the code in the function is more or less throwaway: I only need it to load the participant's data once, when a new object is created. The function has no relevance besides that, and won't be used after creating the object. Does this make sense or would it be more appropriate to turn `parse_data` into a method?"}

I\u2019ve also tried using ijson  \n to iteratively parse the JSON file, but I\u2019m still running into issues.  \nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried so far:  \nimport json  \nwith open('67M\\_generated\\_analysed.json') as f:  \ndata = json.load(f)  \n\\#and with ijson  \nimport ijson  \nwith open('67M\\_generated\\_analysed.json', 'r') as in\\_file, open('67M\\_generated\\_analysed.ndjson', 'w') as out\\_file:  \nobjects = ijson.items(in\\_file, 'item')  \nfor item in objects:  \nout\\_file.write(json.dumps(item) + '\\\\n')  \nBoth of these approaches result in a MemoryError  \n. I\u2019m  looking for a way to process this file without loading the entire thing  into memory at once. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly  appreciated!  \nThank you in advance for your help!"}

I'm not a programmer at all, but am trying to make a script for some excel work. I'm sure there's better ways to do it than what I've tried (getting code from chatgpt and looking for already complete code), but I'm needing it to be finished by Monday at the latest. \n\nEssentially, the script needs to read an excel file that is going to have the UTF8 code for characters in column A. Columns B-F are going to have true/false flags on whether the script needs to search for that particular character based on the column it will be searching in the second document. The output just needs to have the location of where that character is found in the searched file. I'm sure this is possible somehow, but since I've never written any code in my life beyond the intros to tutorials, I don't even know where to start this to actually get a working script. \n\nI don't know if this makes sense or if this is even the right subreddit to ask, so please let me know if it's not."}

The \"down sampling\" is just to avoid slowing down the matplotlib plotting engine. I want the user to see the same plot every time they look at the data with the same settings / input.\n\nCode here:\n\n    import numpy as np\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    import time\n    \n    # Generate fake data\n    x = np.random.normal(size=2000)\n    y = x * 2 + np.random.normal(size=2000)\n    \n    sampleRNG = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    \n    # The for loop to simulate user inputing differnt down-sample settings\n    for down_sample_size in [500, 600, 200, 500, 700]:\n    \n        # problem solved if the following line is not commented out\n        # sampleRNG = np.random.default_rng(42)\n        \n        randIndex = sampleRNG.choice(len(x), size=down_sample_size, replace=False, axis=0, shuffle=False)\n        \n        fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n        ax.scatter(x[randIndex], y[randIndex], s=2)\n        plt.show()\n        \n        time.sleep(1)\n\nNote, the \"for loop\" in the above code is just for mimicking users changing the down-sample settings to look at the data again. My goal is to have the first and forth plot (both with a down-sample size at 500) looks the same. This will be resolved if I put the `sampleRNG = np.random.default_rng(42)` inside the loop, but I am wondering if this is the right thing to do.\n\nMethod I have considered to get around:\n\n1. Shuffle the sample when it's loaded, and only take the first N points of the sample when user requires to down sample to N. This is like pre-rendering the data, but it will take double the memory, as I do want to keep the original data order. \n\nFeedback is welcome...."}

This adds quite a bit of overhead that slows down our upgrades.\n\nTherefore, we are exploring the following: why not build an API that returns the plots directly and have the webapp embed them in the web pages? The plots would be created by a Python backend which creates the plot upon receiving a request and returns them as a suitable format (HTML/JS?). With this approach, I would be in charge of handling the data and creating the visualisations, ideally without bothering the devs because the webapp will just display whatever the API is returning.\n\nSo my question is: can it be done? And if it can, does it make sense at all? Would you advise against it? Is there someone here that has tried this route and has some tips to share?\n\nWhich tools are best for this job? I am considering Plotly, Bokeh and Holoviz's Panel, but I am overwhelmed by the options and unsure what to choose and what are the tradeoffs. What I care about the most is interactivity and customizability of the plots. Ideally, the style of the plots can be changed to match that of the webapp using CSS files."}

I see that there are other posts similar in the past, but they recommend stuff like ML, tensorflow, or something about perceptual hashing.   \n\n\nGiven that the base image set has varying dimensions from 800x800 to possibly 2160 x 3840, and the image snippet I need to find the origin for could be as small as 200x200 or less, for example, and is not expected to have any funny business like rotations involved, though preserving the colour values is very likely critical information in finding the image given how small the image is and thus the information we have. \n\nI was wondering if all that was truly needed, and if a simple matching against segments of a larger matrix as an idea wasn't gonna work at all.  \n\n\nAttached are the 3 variants of the script I wrote, in advancing order of tests done.

For those unfamiliar with SolidWorks item numbers in a BOM, SolidWorks will create a hierarchical list of item numbers for an assembly. There are \"Parent\" item numbers and \"Child\" item numbers, for an example the item number for the main assembly would be 1 (which would be a parent) then you would have parts within that assembly which are numbered like this 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc. With larger assemblies you will have sub assemblies for an example lets say 1.1 is a sub assembly so it will also have child item numbers like 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, etc. The script I currently have is able to determine which item numbers are parent items and which are solely child item numbers. Lets say I run my script and I am given these numbers are parent item numbers: 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1), 1.1.2, [1.1.2.5](https://1.1.2.5), 1.1.1.1.1, I want the script to order these in this fashion 1, 1.1, 1.1.2, [1.1.2.5](https://1.1.2.5), 1.1.1, [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1), 1.1.1.1.1, I want them in this order because 1.1.2 is a child of 1.1 and not a child of 1.1.1 and [1.1.2.5](https://1.1.2.5) is a child of 1.1.2 so i want it directly after 1.1.2 I hope this makes sense it is hard for me to explain this type of thing in words.

These represent connections between the main switches of each location.\n\nThe thing is, I need to extract all of this visual information, into a table, that shows all of the equipment found at each location. Switches are a special case, where the interconnecting lines need to be taken into account and be converted into a graph that shows what is connected to what. \n\nThe main reason I feel this is so difficult is because I need to work around these documents that lack consistency:\n\n* The text is always the same, but the symbols for equipment change\n* The location boxes not always \"contain\" the equipment inside.

Images are not common, but they can happen.\n* The brightly colored lines that interconnect locations change color, and may sometimes consist of a single line that branches into multiple other location, or each interconnection may be represented by an individual line.\n\nHas anyone tackled a similar problem and has found a specific way to do it.

If those also have dependencies, isn't this a Russian doll type exercise - surely there must be a much easier way?? \n\nAny help anyone can offer would be gratefully received."}

This requires the same functionality as implemented in 'make\\_prediction', but without a 'Run' instance. I need a static method that identical, except that the model is provided as method argument instead of an instance attribute.\n\nI've been thinking about the most elegant or Pythonic way to implement this, but the answer is unclear to me. I could essentially make a static copy of the attribute method, but that would lead to code duplication.

{"title": "Processing.py making Hitboxes", "score": 2, "id": "1c0cj2r", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1c0cj2r/processingpy_making_hitboxes/", "num_comments": 4, "body": "Hi all, looking for another set of eyes on this as I'm quite stumped. I know it's a stretch given the specifics, but here I am.\n\nI have been messing around with MIT's Processing for Python and I am trying to make a little Whack-a-Mole game for a class demonstration. The following code is that of determining the hitbox of the mole. Basically, I draw a circle at a random X, Y coordinate on the page, and then get all of the coordinates within that (X-5, Y-5) (X+5, Y+5) space to serve at the hitbox (if there is an easier solution, ***PLEASE*** let me know). I then check if the current mouse position is highlighting one of those coordinates, and we're sailing.\n\nThis all works. The problem arises when I try to slow down the mole generation. Working with processing, the def draw() function loops something over and over at 60 fps by default. When adding an if statement to slow down the rate of drawing, nothing works anymore. And lovely Processing doesn't return error feedback. I like to think that I've narrowed the error down to adding an if statement, but honestly who knows. Here is the code:\n\n    def setup():\n        size(600, 600)\n    def draw():\n        ellX = random(20, width-20)\n        ellY = random(20, height-20)\n    # add in something like \"if frameCount%120 == 1:\" to try and spawn a \"mole\" \n    # every 2 seconds rather than 60 times per second\n        fill(255)\n        ellipse(ellX, ellY, 10, 10)\n        mole = hitbox(int(ellX-5), int(ellY-5), int(ellX+5), int(ellY+5))\n    \n        if mousePressed == True:\n            if mouseX and mouseY in mole:\n                print \"Hit\"\n            else:\n                print \"Miss\"\n    \n    def hitbox(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n        hitboxSize = []\n        for i in range(x2-x1+1):\n            resx = x1 + i\n            resy = y1 + i\n            hitboxSize.append(resx)\n            hitboxSize.append(resy)\n        return hitboxSize\n\nI don't understand why adding an if statement regarding the frameCount would affect the mousePressed command (which, upon pressing the mouse, is what crashes the program once the if statement is present). Again, a stretch, I know, but any help is appreciated. Thank you!"}

This handles all the logic. Then, I have wrapper methods `_get_by_name()`, `_get_by_id()`, etc, all with properly typed args, which simply wraps the generic `_get()`.\n\nFinally, in subclasses of `Endpoint`, I declare the public `get()` method. Here's a basic example.\n\n    class Endpoint:\n        def _get(identifier: str | int, *args, **kwargs):\n            # Make the API call\n    \n        def _get_by_name(name: str, *args, **kwargs):\n            return self._get(identifier=name, *args, **kwargs)\n    \n        def _get_by_id(id: int, *args, **kwargs):\n            return self._get(identifier=id, *args, **kwargs)\n    \n    class NameEndpoint(Endpoint):\n        PATH = \"/path/to/endpoint/url\"\n        # This endpoint uses \"name\" as its unique identifier\n        get = Endpoint._get_by_name\n    \n    class IdEndpoint(Endpoint):\n        PATH = \"/path/to/other/endpoint/url\"\n        get = Endpoint._get_by_id\n\nThe net result is that now instances of `NameEndpoint` have a public `get()` method with a signature that includes the \"name\" keyword arg, and it suggested in IDEs for autocomplete. And so-on for endpoints that use ID, or other identifiers.\n\nThis works, but feels really hack-ish and I feel strongly like I've done some horrible un-pythonic thing, and that there's a much cleaner way to achieve this, perhaps with decorators or some other such magic I've yet to grasp.

I don't think its an error on the site or in my script since it will run flawlessly for days.\n\nAny guidance would be appreciated.\n\n----------------------------\n\nLast night:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n\n  File \"G:\\\\Users\\\\XXX\\\\Documents\\\\Scripts\\\\All.py\", line 47, in <module>\n\nu = driver.get(url)\n\n  File \"G:\\\\Users\\\\XXX\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python38-32\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\n\n\\\\selenium\\\\webdriver\\\\remote\\\\webdriver.py\", line 357, in get\n\nself.execute(Command.GET, {\"url\": url})\n\n  File \"G:\\\\Users\\\\XXX\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python38-32\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\n\n\\\\selenium\\\\webdriver\\\\remote\\\\webdriver.py\", line 348, in execute\n\nself.error\\_handler.check\\_response(response)\n\n  File \"G:\\\\Users\\\\XXX\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python38-32\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\n\n\\\\selenium\\\\webdriver\\\\remote\\\\errorhandler.py\", line 229, in check\\_response\n\nraise exception\\_class(message, screen, stacktrace)\n\nselenium.common.exceptions.TimeoutException: Message: timeout: Timed out receivi\n\nng message from renderer: 299.628\n\n  (Session info: chrome=109.0.5414.120)\n\nStacktrace:\n\nBacktrace:\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x01446643\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x013DBE21\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012DDA9D\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012CF55A\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012CF2D8\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012CDC68\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012CE647\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012D8568\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012E4956\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012E81C6\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012CE9F1\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012E46D5\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x01347057\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x0132FB76\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x013049C1\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x01305E5D\\]\n\nGetHandleVerifier \\[0x016BA142+2497106\\]\n\nGetHandleVerifier \\[0x016E85D3+2686691\\]\n\nGetHandleVerifier \\[0x016EBB9C+2700460\\]\n\nGetHandleVerifier \\[0x014F3B10+635936\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x013E4A1F\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x013EA418\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x013EA505\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x013F508B\\]\n\nBaseThreadInitThunk \\[0x7564EF3C+18\\]\n\nRtlInitializeExceptionChain \\[0x76DE360C+239\\]\n\nRtlInitializeExceptionChain \\[0x76DE35DF+194\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nG:\\\\Users\\\\XXX\\\\Documents\\\\Scripts>\n\n==========================================\n\nAnd this afternoon:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n\n  File \"G:\\\\Users\\\\XXX\\\\Documents\\\\Scripts\\\\All.py\", line 79, in <module>\n\nu = driver.get(url2)\n\n  File \"G:\\\\Users\\\\XXX\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python38-32\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\n\n\\\\selenium\\\\webdriver\\\\remote\\\\webdriver.py\", line 357, in get\n\nself.execute(Command.GET, {\"url\": url})\n\n  File \"G:\\\\Users\\\\XXX\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python38-32\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\n\n\\\\selenium\\\\webdriver\\\\remote\\\\webdriver.py\", line 348, in execute\n\nself.error\\_handler.check\\_response(response)\n\n  File \"G:\\\\Users\\\\XXX\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python38-32\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\n\n\\\\selenium\\\\webdriver\\\\remote\\\\errorhandler.py\", line 229, in check\\_response\n\nraise exception\\_class(message, screen, stacktrace)\n\nselenium.common.exceptions.TimeoutException: Message: timeout: Timed out receivi\n\nng message from renderer: 299.730\n\n  (Session info: chrome=109.0.5414.120)\n\nStacktrace:\n\nBacktrace:\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x01446643\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x013DBE21\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012DDA9D\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012CF55A\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012CF2D8\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012CDC68\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012CE647\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012D8568\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012E4956\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012E81C6\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012CE9F1\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x012E46D5\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x01347057\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x0132FB76\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x013049C1\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x01305E5D\\]\n\nGetHandleVerifier \\[0x016BA142+2497106\\]\n\nGetHandleVerifier \\[0x016E85D3+2686691\\]\n\nGetHandleVerifier \\[0x016EBB9C+2700460\\]\n\nGetHandleVerifier \\[0x014F3B10+635936\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x013E4A1F\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x013EA418\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x013EA505\\]\n\n(No symbol) \\[0x013F508B\\]\n\nBaseThreadInitThunk \\[0x7564EF3C+18\\]\n\nRtlInitializeExceptionChain \\[0x76DE360C+239\\]\n\nRtlInitializeExceptionChain \\[0x76DE35DF+194\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nG:\\\\Users\\\\XXX\\\\Documents\\\\Scripts>\n\n"}

I am wondering if there is a way of exctracting from the class on the global scope so they can get individually verified by: level, cost, buff, type.\n\nOf course, i realize that i can just write it the long way, frame by frame and label by label to make each optionmenu unique to be able to easily verify it, but there has to be a way to not make a 500 code long just for a tech tree which, in theory, is easy to do.\n\nAlso, if you have any tip of how i can write it more efficiently, i am open for any suggestions.\n\nI will attach the main source code with a few things changed/removed  + any things related to it here:\n\n    import customtkinter as ctk\n    \n    example = {'levels': [{'level 1': 30000,\n                       'level 2': 65000,\n                       'level 3': 120000,\n                       'level 4': 165000,\n                       'level 5': 220000,\n                       }],\n           'buffs': [{0: 0,\n                  1: 1,\n                  2: 2,\n                  3: 3,\n                  4: 4,\n                  5: 5}],\n           'type': 'C'}\n    #dict will have all the techs with each indivdual name and attributes.\n    def get_level_cost(name, level): \n    x = name['levels'] \n    levels_x = x[0] \n    return levels_x.get(level)\n    \n    levels = ['level 1', 'level 2', 'level 3', 'level 4', 'level 5'] # for the optionmenu only\n    \n    class Tech(ctk.CTkFrame): \n      def init(self, master, dict_name, **kwargs): # dict_name to be able to extract from the dict a tech name \n        super().init(master, **kwargs)\n         self.rowconfigure((0, 1, 2), weight=1) \n        self.columnconfigure((0, 1, 2), weight=1, uniform='a')\n    \n        self.labeltec = ctk.CTkLabel(self, text=dict_name) # i added this just for the clickedcall() func to work properly, no need to add it visible.\n    \n        self.optmenu = ctk.CTkOptionMenu(self, values=levels, command=self.clickedcall, width=200,\n                                         font=('Helvetica', 18))\n        self.optmenu.grid(row=2, column=0, sticky='nsew', pady=5, padx=10, columnspan=2)\n    \n    def clickedcall(self, choice):\n        name_get = self.labeltec.cget('text')\n        name_get = eval(name_get)\n    \n        return get_level_cost(name_get, choice)\n    \n    class MainTechFrame(ctk.CTkScrollableFrame): \n      def init(self, master, **kwargs): \n        super().init(master, **kwargs) \n        self.rowconfigure((0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), weight=1) \n        self.columnconfigure((0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), weight=1, uniform='a')\n        self.t = Tech(self, 'example')\n        self.t.grid(row=0, column=0)\n    \n    class App(ctk.CTk):  \n      def init(self): \n        super().init() \n        self.grid_rowconfigure((0, 1), weight=1) \n        self.grid_columnconfigure((0, 1), weight=1) \n        self.geometry('1980x1080')\n        self.my_frame = MainTechFrame(master=self, width=300, height=200, corner_radius=0, fg_color=\"grey\",\n                                      orientation='horizontal')\n        self.my_frame.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky=\"nsew\", columnspan=2)\n    \n    app = App() \n    app.mainloop()"}

Your team of linguists has determined that each word in the alien language has an accent on exactly one position (letter) in the word; the part of the word starting from the accented letter is called the accent-suffix. Two words are said to rhyme if both of their accent-suffixes are equal. For example, the words PROL and TARPOL rhyme if the accented letter in both is the O or the L, but they do not rhyme if the accented letters are the Rs, or the R in PROL and the P in TARPOL, or the O in PROL and the L in TARPOL.\n\nYou have recovered a list of words that may be part of an alien poem. Unfortunately, you do not know which is the accented letter for each word. You believe that you can discard zero or more of these words, assign accented letters to the remaining words, and then arrange those words into pairs such that each word rhymes only with the other word in its pair, and with none of the words in other pairs.\n\nYou want to know the largest number of words that can be arranged into pairs in this way.\n\n......................\n\nMy idea was that the largest number of pairs asked in the problem can be achieved by creating pairs that could generate the largest accent suffix per pair possible then add the lengths of each largest accent suffix up.\n\nExample:\n\nCODEJAM\n\nJAM\n\nHAM\n\nNALAM\n\nHUM\n\nNOLOM\n\nas pairs will be:\n\nCODEJAM - JAM (largest accent suffix = JAM)\n\nHAM - NALAM (largest accent suffix = AM)\n\nHUM - NOLOM (largest accent suffix = M)\n\ntotal number of pairs being asked = 3 (JAM) + 2 (AM) + 1 (M) = 6\n\nTo do this in code, I assigned one word from the list of words given to be the current word then got the largest accent suffix it shared with each of the other words in the list. I then organized the lengths of these accent suffixes in a dictionary named index_accent_suffix_dict. I got the length of the largest accent suffix from this dictionary and added it to the largest_number_of_pairs counter (the number of pairs being asked in the problem). I then removed the current word and word with length of largest accent suffix from the list of words, assigned another current word from the list of words given, and repeated the process done to the first current word over and over until the list of words has only one word left or no words left.

However,\n\nfor the second one I tried: `my_dog = Dog.dog_constructor('Willie', 10)` which did not work. Then eventually\n\nI was told that I should use\n\n    my_dog = Dog()\n    my_dog.dog_constructor('Willie', 5).\n\nI am so confused about why we should use this approach.\n\nCan anyone explain to me the importance of having an `__init__` method in a class and why instances are created differently depending on whether we have `__init__` or not?\n\nI have been struggling with this for a while but still cannot grasp it.\n\nI'd be very thankful for the explanation!

Could somebody please help me?\n\nI'm sorry for my spelling mistakes in my code.\n\n    import os\n    import time\n    \n    \n    class Coords:\n        def __init__(self, y, x):\n            self.y = y\n            self.x = x\n    \n    \n    START = Coords(0, 0)\n    FINISH = Coords(3, 3)\n    SIZE = Coords(4, 4)\n    \n    \n    class Tile:\n    \n        def __init__(self, hCost, gCost, isWall, parent):\n            self.hCost = hCost\n            self.gCost = gCost\n            self.fCost = (hCost + gCost)\n            self.isWall = isWall\n            self.parent = parent\n    \n    \n    def prRed(skk): print(\"\\033[91m{}\\033[00m\" .format(skk), end=\"\")\n    \n    \n    def prCyan(skk): print(\"\\033[96m{}\\033[00m\" .format(skk), end=\"\")\n    \n    \n    def prGreen(skk): print(\"\\033[92m{}\\033[00m\" .format(skk), end=\"\")\n    \n    \n    def prYellow(skk): print(\"\\033[93m{}\\033[00m\" .format(skk), end=\"\")\n    \n    \n    def print_grid(grid, current, fullGrid):\n        os.system('clear')\n        for i in range(0, SIZE.y):\n            for j in range(0, SIZE.x):\n                if i == START.y and j == START.x:\n                    prGreen(\"S\")\n                elif i == FINISH.y and j == FINISH.x:\n                    prYellow(\"F\")\n                elif fullGrid[i][j]:\n                    prRed(\"X\")\n                elif i == current.y and j == current.x:\n                    prCyan(\"P\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"0\", end=\"\")\n            print()\n    \n    def calculate_h_cost(position):\n        y = (FINISH.y -

My professor doesn't give us any info on what to do, just new assignments with the due date, all my learning in this class was all from youtube, which is why im confused on what this code means. Here is the code.\n\nEdit: Sorry if the code looks a bit weird, i just copied and pasted it, im new to reddit i don't really know how this site works\n\n    import pygame\n    \n    SCR_WID, SCR_HEI = 640, 480 class Player(): def init(self): self.x, self.y = 16, SCR_HEI/2 self.speed = 3 self.padWid, self.padHei = 8, 64 self.score = 0 self.scoreFont = pygame.font.Font(\"imagine_font.ttf\", 64)\n    \n        def scoring(self):\n                scoreBlit = self.scoreFont.render(str(self.score), 1, (255, 255, 255))\n                screen.blit(scoreBlit, (32, 16))\n                if self.score == 10:\n                        print (\"player 1 wins!\")\n                        exit()\n       \n        def movement(self):\n                keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()\n                if keys[pygame.K_w]:\n                        self.y -= self.speed\n                elif keys[pygame.K_s]:\n                        self.y += self.speed\n       \n                if self.y <= 0:\n                        self.y = 0\n                elif self.y >= SCR_HEI-64:\n                        self.y = SCR_HEI-64\n       \n        def draw(self):\n                pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 255, 255), (self.x, self.y, self.padWid, self.padHei))\n    \n    class Enemy():\n           def init(self): \n           self.x, self.y = SCR_WID-16, SCR_HEI/2 \n           self.speed = 3 \n           self.padWid, self.padHei = 8, 64 \n           self.score = 0 \n           self.scoreFont = pygame.font.Font(\"imagine_font.ttf\", 64)\n    \n        def scoring(self):\n                scoreBlit = self.scoreFont.render(str(self.score), 1, (255, 255, 255))\n                screen.blit(scoreBlit, (SCR_HEI+92, 16))\n                if self.score == 10:\n                        print (\"Player 2 wins!\")\n                        exit()\n       \n        def movement(self):\n                keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()\n                if keys[pygame.K_UP]:\n                        self.y -= self.speed\n                elif keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:\n                        self.y += self.speed\n       \n                if self.y <= 0:\n                        self.y = 0\n                elif self.y >= SCR_HEI-64:\n                        self.y = SCR_HEI-64\n       \n        def draw(self):\n                pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 255, 255), (self.x, self.y, self.padWid, self.padHei))\n    \n    class Ball(): \n           def init(self): \n                 self.x, self.y = SCR_WID/2, SCR_HEI/2 \n                 self.speed_x = -3 \n                 self.speed_y = 3\n                 self.size = 8\n    \n        def movement(self):\n                self.x += self.speed_x\n                self.y += self.speed_y\n    \n                #wall col\n                if self.y <= 0:\n                        self.speed_y *= -1\n                elif self.y >= SCR_HEI-self.size:\n                        self.speed_y *= -1\n    \n                if self.x <= 0:\n                        self.__init__()\n                        enemy.score += 1\n                elif self.x >= SCR_WID-self.size:\n                        self.__init__()\n                        self.speed_x = 3\n                        player.score += 1\n                ##wall col\n                #paddle col\n                #player\n                for n in range(-self.size, player.padHei):\n                        if self.y == player.y + n:\n                                if self.x <= player.x + player.padWid:\n                                        self.speed_x *= -1\n                                        break\n                        n += 1\n                #enemy\n                for n in range(-self.size, enemy.padHei):\n                        if self.y == enemy.y + n:\n                                if self.x >= enemy.x -

It works for simple data analysis, but it gets nasty if the script is too long, easy to get lost. And some other cons that are known already.\n\nThe most obvius alternative is to execute it normally using the python terminal, but another thing that annoys even more is how cluttered the terminal becomes.

My problem is day 1-3 were easy and I got all of the exercises right but past day 4 I failed almost each one of the challenges. She shows in previous lesson and explains how these new things work what we are currently learning and after giving an exercise.   \nI need to watch her solutions to finish the exercise basically copy paste her code to my replit. I have been learning few days only and I am a complete beginner in Python and never had any experience with any of the other programming languages.\n\nIs it worth continue like this when I just watch her solutions then they kind of makes sense to me I do understand what she is doing but not sure if this educates me to finally solve these problems myself.   \nI feel like I don't have this programming logical thinking I understand what she asks of me and I know what the code should do but I can not come up with a solution my self.\n\nIs it a waste of time doing what I do or what experiences other people have learning?  \nI do really want to make this work and start working some day as a developer of some sort.\n\nI feel like being so dumb not figuring out the solutions myself that I'm not meant to be a programmer.\n\nThank you."}

I try to give the version a large supported range by default, but sometimes I need to use a specific function that is only available in recent major releases, so I have to pin \\`package\\_a == 2.0.0\\`, but some users of our project may have restrictions and can only use \\`1.0.0\\`. A recent example of this is the \\`pedantic\\` package, and I wonder how people usually manage this, especially when the project grows, or that big company builds complex projects; they probably depend on way more packages than I do.

I had only taken one programming class many years ago in college (industrial engineering) in the \"Pascal\" language.\n\nAnd taking advantage of the fact that I had a few months off due to a job change, I took the opportunity to dedicate myself full time to taking several Python courses and I'm going to tell you what I think is perhaps the best way to start for a newbie. \n\n\n\n**freeCodecamp: overall rating: 6.5/10**\n\n[https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)\n\nPros:\n\n> A lot of practice from the beginning\n\n> Code editor in the browser\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n> I think its need more explanation of the topics\n\n> The explanations of the different topics are scattered throughout 10 course-projects that you have to carry out. And if you want to review a particular topic you have to search through the different steps of each project. And each project sometimes has up to 90 steps.\n\n\n\nIn general, you can see the great effort and dedication they put into this course, but I think, at least in my case, I was not able to retain much of what I learned.\n\nI think that each topic should be explained a little more in depth and give more examples before moving on to do the projects themselves.\n\nLack of organization of content. For example, the explanation of what a dictionary is, perhaps it is in step 38 of project \"x\" and after a while you forget where that explanation is and you have to go through all the steps to find it.\n\n\n\n**Harvard CS50P: overall rating: 9/10**\n\n[https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/)\n\nPros\n\n> Lectures are on another level. David Malan's explanations are legendary\n\n> Good organization of topics\n\n> A decent amount of exercises to perform\n\nCons\n\n> not much to say, maybe they could add more exercises to practice. I think the key to learning programming is to practice and practice.\n\n\n\n**Helsinki Python Programming MOOC: overall rating: 9,5/10**\n\n[https://programming-24.mooc.fi/](https://programming-24.mooc.fi/)\n\npros:\n\n> Lots of practice. Each week you have between 20 and 40 exercises to practice.\n\n> The first 3 weeks you will work in a text editor in the browser and in the fourth week you will go to visual studio on your own computer\n\n> Some exercises are really challenging. The last one of week 5 is beautiful for those who like challenges\n\ncons:\n\n> not much to say. Only minor issues like sometimes a sentence is not translated into English but I would say that 99.5% are translated correctly.\n\n\n\nYou can see the great dedication they put into it. I think they also have video classes but just reading the explanation on the page is enough to be able to do the exercises.\n\nI had a technical issue with one of the exercises, which I couldn't do because I couldn't access a JSON of a web page that they give you. That's why I don't give it a 10/10.\n\n\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nIf I could start again, I think the ideal path is to first watch David Malan's CS50P lectures and then do the Helsinki MOOC. And if you have the time and desire, do the complete CS50P and then the Helsinki MOOC.\n\nI think the key to learning and being able to start making your own programs is to practice and practice. And for that, the Helsinki course is great because of the amount of exercises they offer.\n\n"}

For this most recent RPA/web automation project, I'm trying to learn to be more pythonic and break things up into a proper \\_\\_main\\_\\_.py and some sensible modules.

In the rare case  I need to make something defined in a function available to everything else, I can use GLOBAL and get it done easily.\n\nIn my (I think wrong?) pythonic way, I now have bi-directional passing and passing back hell.  Example: Every workflow uses slack, so getting the slack client is part of `setup.py` (calling `slack_helper_functions.py`).  But now if a workflow calls `gsheet_helper_functions.py,` I have to pass the slack client to it for anything there to be able to send a slack message.  Same with config values.  `workflow_a` pulls its config from its respective `config.py`, but then has to pass config values to any called module (setup, cleanup, or helpers) in order for config values to be accessible to them.  In monolithic world I could just read in the config in my if name == main, then it would be accessible in any function w/o explicitly passing it.  \n\n\nSo, no my function calls look like `func_resp = some_func(shit, tons, of, freaking, function, args, are, you, kidding, me, why, did, I, do, this)`\n\nI could solve this with a common 'payload' dict defined in worfkflow\\_#.py, and just pass the dict around to reduce the number of function args, but that seems super smelly/cheaty to me.  I'd just as soon go back to monolithic if that's the only solution...so I think I'm doing pythonic wrong.  \n\n\nwhat do I need to change/improve about my thinking to make the jump to a more pythonic project structure w/o having arg passing hell?  \n"}

Currently, I have code that accepts user input, and then proceeds to add widgets to the screen that displays what will soon be weather info for the input (the location)- this display includes the input string. If the API does not find any data on the location given by the user, the program adds a widget that displays \"invalid input\". While I was building this code up, the textual screen would add a scroll bar once there were too many widgets on the screen to be displayed all at once. However, once I added the if/else code that checks whether the response code is valid, this auto-scrolling no longer occurred.

Any pointers?", "score": 3, "id": "1bwsbtc", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1bwsbtc/want_to_write_a_program_to_encourageremind_me_to/", "num_comments": 5, "body": "Trying to organise my basic daily life with Python.  Any pointers?\n\nHi.  I\u2019m neurodivergent and have some adhd related difficulties with basic daily tasks.  I need reminders and encouragement from others to manage my daily life.  For example, if someone doesn\u2019t gently encourage me to eat then sometimes I just won\u2019t eat, same with things like washing, grocery shopping, drinking enough water etc.  I can do all of these things but remembering or finding the motivation to actually do them is very difficult to maintain.  It\u2019s been frustrating because I have a job, pay my own bills etc but can\u2019t maintain an organised daily life when it comes to the basics.\n\nTo develop more independence, I would like to use a simple program that encourages me and reminds me to do these basic things each day, ie having my desktop pop up each day checking I\u2019ve had lunch rather than relying on another person to ask me if I forget.  Then if I haven\u2019t yet, having my desktop check in again a little later.  I\u2019ve tried some reminder apps but they\u2019re not interactive enough to work for me.\n\nSo for example, say I\u2019ve gone too long without a shower without realising.  I would like to avoid this with a program where my desktop pops up to ask me when I last showered and encourage me to do so if it\u2019s been beyond a certain timeframe, then check in again later to confirm I\u2019ve done it or remind me I still need to do it.  And have my desktop do that with all kinds of basic tasks eg checking in to confirm I\u2019ve eaten, drank enough water, fed my pets etc.\n\nI know this sounds really silly because who would ever forget to shower or eat but I do all the time and it\u2019s really holding me back.  I would like to be more independent and not rely on the encouragement of other people so often to do such basic things but I just can\u2019t quite manage to do it consistently.  I hold down a job, pay my bills etc but I just can\u2019t quite get the hang of managing my own basic daily tasks day to day.  \n\nAm I right in thinking I could automate this with python so my computer can remind and encourage me to eat, drink, wash etc instead of other people having to remind and encourage me?  \n\nAny reference material or programming advice would be appreciated.  I\u2019d like to keep my program/project as simple as possible so I\u2019m not trying to make it respond to my voice or talk to me like an Alexa or something.  I just want my computer to ask me things like \u201chave you made dinner yet?\u201d And then send reminder messages if not.  \n\nThank you"}

I'm learning that I can use Python to scrape web data and was wondering if it was at all possible for a Python program to somehow take the text from a video game (For instance, the data I'm expecting to get is stuff like \"Spy behind you Sniper!\" or \"Switch off Hanzo you are terrible\" and be able to use that data as part of a larger program in real time like a text to speech app. (OW already has something like this but I want to see if I can make it myself.)"}
